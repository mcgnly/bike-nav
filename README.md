# Bike Navigation Android App

An android application for city navigation by bike. The in-transit display will be handled 
by lighting LED, rather than by using the phone display, and it will provide turn-by-turn navigation 
direction using an API call.

The application is created as part of the [Learn IT, Girl!](http://www.learnitgirl.com) program by Katie McGinley,
 who is being mentored by [Jakub Danek](http://www.danekja.org).
